Request Headers:

User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.29.0
The client's string for the server to use to id the apps, os, or user agent

Accept: */*
What is being accepted meaning what is the acceptable response type

Postman-Token: 9af57923-980c-4a7a-817f-9d2d7bcf5b11
Basically a token/id for the header

Host: www.googleapis.com
Would request the header to specify the host and port number to which the server it is sending its request to

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Would request an HTTP header to indicate the encoding so that the client could understand it. Simply means the type of
encodings it would accept for the response.

Connection: keep-alive
Allows a sender to hint how the connection could be used to timeout and remain open for multiple requests/responses.


Response Header:

Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
The type of content that is being requested in an url-encoded application. Would provide information about the content
type of what's being returned.

Vary: Origin
Vary: X-Origin
Vary: Referer
Would be used to prevent caching. Would describe how parts of the requests message would be influenced by
the content of the response.

Content-Encoding: gzip
The format of the data that its being encoded to. It would let the recipient know how to decode the payload/message
and obtain the original payload content. Would be used to compress the data without losing the origin media type.

Date: Sun, 30 Jan 2022 14:27:45 GMT
The current date and time in GMT

Server: ESF
The software the server used by the origin to handle the requests if and only if the server generates a response.

Cache-Control: private
Both requests and responses that control caching in browsers. Means how the requests and responses are handled.

X-XSS-Protection: 0
Feature in Internet Explorer, chrome, and safari that would stop a page from loading when they would detect a cross-site
script attack. Is basically a security measure placed. Is disabled due to most modern browsers that disables it.

X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Would be used to indicate whether a browser would be able to render a page by deciding if it's an object, frame, or
embed. In this case SAMEORIGIN means its displayed as a frame on the same origin as the page itself.

X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
marker used by the server to indicate MIME types in the Content-Type to be followed and not changed. It would allow
for MIME type sniffing by stating that MIME's can't be configured.

Alt-Svc: h3=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-Q050=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-Q046=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-Q043=":443"; ma=2592000,quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="46,43"
Allows for a server to indicate another network location, and be treated as authoritative for that origin when making
a request.

Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Would allow for messages between nodes. Basically means to transfer content. In this case its chunked meaning it would
send data in chunks.
